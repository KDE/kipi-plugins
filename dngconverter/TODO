All:
- Per channel black level offset (require API change in libkdcraw)
- Use calibration matrixes if possible, user has to store them in specific folder
  Question: are there others outside than Adobe ones (free?)
- Add support of Linear DNG conversion

Canon:
- Check if storing active sensor area could be enabled again (Bug with 5MKII, propably solved)
