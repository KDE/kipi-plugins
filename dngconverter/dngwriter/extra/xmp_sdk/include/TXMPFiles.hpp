/// \brief API for access to the main (document-level) metadata in a file_.
///
/// The Adobe XMP Toolkit's file handling component, XMPFiles, is a front end to a set of
/// format-specific file handlers that support file I/O for XMP. The file handlers implement smart,
/// efficient support for those file formats for which the means to embed XMP is defined in the XMP
/// Specification. Where possible, this support allows:
///   \li Injection	of XMP where none currently exists
///   \li Expansion of XMP without regard to existing padding
///   \li Reconciliation of the XMP and other legacy forms of metadata.
///
/// \c TXMPFiles is designed for use by clients interested in the metadata and not in the primary
/// file content; the Adobe Bridge application is a typical example. \c TXMPFiles is not intended to
/// be appropriate for files authored by an application; that is, those files for which the
/// application has explicit knowledge of the file format.

/// \class TXMPFiles TXMPFiles.hpp
/// \brief API for access to the main (document-level) metadata in a file.
///
/// \c TXMPFiles is a template class that provides the API for the Adobe XMP Toolkit's XMPFiles
/// component. This provides convenient access to the main, or document level, XMP for a file. Use
/// it to obtain metadata from a file, which you can then manipulate with the XMP Core component
/// (the classes \c TXMPMeta, \c TXMPUtils, and \c TXMPIterator); and to write new or changed
/// metadata back out to a file.
///
/// The functions allow you to open a file, read and write the metadata, then close the file.
/// While open, portions of the file might be maintained in RAM data structures. Memory
/// usage can vary considerably depending onfile format and access options.
///
/// A file can be opened for read-only or read-write access, with typical exclusion for both
/// modes. Errors result in the throw of an \c XMPError exception.
///
/// \c TXMPFiles is the template class. It must be instantiated with a string class such as
/// \c std::string. Read the Toolkit Overview for information about the overall architecture of the XMP
/// API, and the documentation for \c XMP.hpp for specific instantiation instructions.
///
/// Access these functions through the concrete class, \c SXMPFiles.
