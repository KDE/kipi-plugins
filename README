Notes :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- More specific compilation and installation options can be used with the 'configure' script.
Check this with './configure --help' command line.

- The slideshow plugin needs OpenGL support to compile. By default it relies on OpenGL support
compiled into your version of the Qt library. If this is not the case you can link against
external OpenGL libraries with './configure --enable-opengl'. If you prefer to use Mesa instead
use this: './configure --enable-opengl --with-mesa'.

- Some plugins can be disabled during the build process. Check the end of 'configure.in.in' file
and decomment the plugin lines corresponding. Then start the installation procedure.
