kipicmd - Allows you to start kipi-plugins from the command line

This program can be used to easily start kipi-plugins from the command line which is useful when developing plugins. You can specify which action of the plugin should be called and which images/albums should be reported as 'currently selected'.

Example command flow:

# list the available plugins and actions:
kipicmd --listplugins

# Start the "Edit Coordinates..." action from GPSSync plugin with all jpg files in the current directory as selected images:
kipicmd -a "Edit Coordinates..." --selectedimages *.jpg

# Load only the GPSSync plugin because we know that it is the plugin providing the action we want. This may speed up loading on older versions of libkipi:
kipicmd -l kipiplugin_gpssync -a "Edit Coordinates..." --selectedimages *.jpg

# Run "Export to &HTML..." with 'somedir' as the selected directory and 'dir1' and 'dir2' as other albums which could be selected:
kipicmd -a "Export to &HTML..." --selectedalbums somedir --allalbums dir1 dir2

# Run the "Export to Flick&r..." action. Since the dialog is non-modal, we have to wait for it to close:
kipicmd -a "Export to Flick&r..." --wait --selectedimages *.jpg
