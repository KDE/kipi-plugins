Found QT odd behaviors
- QPageSetupDialog::open does not set QPrinter correctly (Unix?) -> used exec
- QPrinter Custom page size (HP CUPS settings) is restored as custom 0,0
- QPrintDialog(Qprinter*) does not care QPrinter margins if OutputFormat
  is set as PdfFormat or PostScriptFormat
- QPrinterInfo::availablePrinters() seems to be usefull for PageSizes
  only for default in case of printers :(
