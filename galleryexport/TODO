Somewhat immediate implementation needed:

* Implement *.ui files for all dialogs that don't want to be kdialog[base] based
* Return more sensible error strings
* Implement logging to backtrace problems
* Abstract the communications layer 100%
* Rename to websync
* Add support for other web backends

For the lazy times:

* Polish the html code used to render the thumbnails, better
  fonts sizes and layout
