Immediate todo:

* kwallet integration to save/restore url, name, password
* show album title along with album name in the treeview.
  (preferably show album title as the main text and album
   name italicized under it)

For the lazy times:

* polish the html code used to render the thumbnails, better
  fonts sizes and layout
