- port Googlemaps widget to API v3 : 

just came across the Google Maps API v3:
http://code.google.com/intl/de/apis/maps/documentation/v3/

It no longer needs an API key, this means embedding in the GPS sync plugin
would no longer require using digikam3rdparty (=> faster loading?). Embedding
in Desktop apps seems to be encouraged:

v3/browse_thread/thread/8c187e778ce921c8

- implement automatic tagging of geotagged images using (reverse) geocoding:
http://code.google.com/intl/de/apis/maps/documentation/v3/services.html
For functionality like "tag all images here with the name of the city they are
taken in", or "find all images taken in city <...>"...
