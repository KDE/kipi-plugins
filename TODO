See plugins to see specifics to do list by tools.

Common todo list :

 * Factoring Image Resize code and widget used in web export tools to libkipiplugins 
   (flickr, PicasaWeb, smug, KIOExportImport, facebook, shwup, etc...)
   * Resize to new dimension
   * Extract JPG preview from RAW files
   * Convert image to JPG/PNG 
 * ImageList widget improvements
   * Thumbnail and List view (user can switch)
   * Editable fields (use case Wikimedia upload)
 * Simple single image export mode (Kamoso use-case)
   * quick export mode for single image, no image list, limited options
   * want to pass options and not expect GUI for options
   * could also be action in digikam on single photo right click
 * Export actions on albums (and not selected images)
   * Allow export of whole album/folder/collection
   * Ask for "new album" options for export
 * Common GUI design for export plugins - current state:
   * Flickr/23/Zoomr: two tabs, additional per image options in imagelist
   * Facebook/SmugMug/Shwup: single dialog with imagelist (but very busy)
   * KIO: single dialog with imagelist
   * PicasaWeb: single dialog, NO imagelist
   * Gallery: single dialog, NO imagelist
   * SendImages: KPageWidgetItem
   * Flash: KPageWidgetItem, but with collection selection (NO imagelist)
   * HTML: single dialog, but with collection selection (NO imagelist)
   * Wikimedia: new plugin, need to work on new design
 * Export/Import progress bar (initial implementation for Facebook):
   * should be integrated into dialog itself - image list and progress bar below
   * use KJob for easier integration (Kamoso use-case)
 * Standalone tool for Export plugins
   * similar to DNGconverter
   * may be useful for uploads from Dolphin if .desktop files would be added
   * may introduce upload to multiple destinations
