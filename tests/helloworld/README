This is a sample kipi plugin to demonstrate how to start to implement a new tool.

A plugin is at least constituate of these files :

- CMakeLists.txt                   : a rules to compile tool.
- kipiplugin_helloworld.desktop    : a KDE desktop file to make visible this tool from KIPI host applications.
- Messages.sh                      : a script to extract internationalization strings for translations purpose.
- plugin_helloworld.h              : the definition of tool based on KIPI::Plugin class.
- plugin_helloworld.cpp            : the implemention of tool. Usually we name plugin entry class file as plugin_*.h/.cpp with * the name of tool.

We also provide 2 documentation text files :

- README                           : to give a minimum information about tool
- TODO                             : to list all pending tasks to implement.

It's highly recommend to read comments from source to know how to start the implementation of a new tool. Take a look also to
shared libkipi and kipiplugins/common/libkipiplugins private API.

NOTE: To be able to load this plugin in digiKam for testing purpose, you need to to remove it from banned list of tool in 
void KipiPluginLoader::loadPlugins() method, from core/utilities/kipiiface/kipipluginloader.cpp
